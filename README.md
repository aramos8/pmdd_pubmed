# PMDD Publications in Pubmed

This project builds a dashboard with a summary of the scientific publications available for PMDD research. The dashboard is currently hosted in https://anaramos.shinyapps.io/pmdd_pubmed/

However, a `flexdashboard` version has been built as well and will be deployed on GitHub pages as well. 

## To Do

- Investigate why `pmdd_flex_dashboard.Rmd` is not rendering
- Update colors in dashboard
- Add citation details to dashboard
