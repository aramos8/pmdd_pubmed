# PMDD Publications in Pubmed

This project builds a dashboard with a summary of the scientific publications available for PMDD research. 

The dashboard is currently hosted in https://anaramos.shinyapps.io/pmdd_pubmed/, and it will be hosted in GitHub pages (currently exploring why serverless deployment using `shinylive` is not working).


## To Do

- Update pipeline to use Pubmed data from their FTP service to get citation data
- Look into [GitHub Action](https://github.com/posit-dev/r-shinylive) not building app in GitHub Pages
- Build Snakemake pipeline
- Add citation details to dashboard
- Update colors in dashboard
