# PMDD Publications in Pubmed

This project builds a dashboard with a summary of the scientific publications available for PMDD research. 

The dashboard is currently hosted in https://anaramos.shinyapps.io/pmdd_pubmed/, and it will be hosted in GitHub pages (currently exploring why serverless deployment using `shinylive` is not working).


## To Do

- Build Snakemake pipeline
- Update pipeline to use Pubmed data from their FTP service to get citation data
- Add citation details to dashboard
- Update colors in dashboard
